Key Points in Damodaranâ€™s Approach:
    Realistic Assumptions: Damodaran emphasizes using reasonable growth rates, often tied to reinvestment and ROC.
    Terminal Growth Rate: Conservative, aligned with long-term economic growth.
    WACC as Discount Rate: Ensures all capital costs are considered, especially for companies with both debt and equity financing.
    Sensitivity Analysis: Test the model with different growth rates, WACC, and terminal growth rates to see how the intrinsic value changes with assumptions.


Steps:
    Calculate EBIT: Revenue multiplied by EBIT margin.
    Calculate NOPAT: EBIT after taxes.
    Calculate FCF: NOPAT plus depreciation, minus CapEx and change in NWC.
    Calculate Terminal Value: Using the Gordon Growth Model.
    Discount FCFs and Terminal Value: To present value using WACC.
    Calculate Enterprise Value: Sum of discounted FCFs and terminal value.
    Calculate Equity Value: Enterprise value minus net debt.
    Calculate Intrinsic Value per Share: Equity value divided by shares outstanding
